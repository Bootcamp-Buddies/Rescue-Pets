    <h1 class="header">About Pet Adoption</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">Pet adoption is the process of transferring responsibility for a pet that was previously owned
        by another party
        such as a person, shelter, or rescue organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters and
        rescue groups. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model
        wherein the organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Online pet adoption sites have databases of pets being housed by thousands of animal shelters and rescue groups,
        and are searchable by the public.

        A black cat waiting to be adopted. Because of the superstitions surrounding black cats, they are
        disproportionately more common in shelters than in the general population and less likely to be adopted than are
        cats of other colors.
        People deal with their unwanted pets in many ways. Some people have the pet euthanized (also known as putting
        down or putting to sleep), although many veterinarians do not consider this to be an ethical use of their
        resources for young and healthy animals, while others argue that euthanasia is a more humane option than leaving
        a pet in a cage for very long periods of time. Other people simply release the pet into the wild or otherwise
        abandon it, with the expectation that it will be able to take care of itself or that it will be found and
        adopted. More often, these pets succumb to hunger, weather, traffic, or common and treatable health problems.
        Some people euthanize pets because of terminal illnesses or injuries, while others even do it for common health
        problems that they cannot, or will not, pay to treat. More responsible owners will take the pet to a shelter, or
        call a rescue organization, where it will be cared for properly until a home can be found. Another method is
        rehoming (finding another owner). Reasons for surrendering a pet may be due to allergies, the pet-owner's death,
        divorce, the birth of a baby, or relocation.

    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Homes cannot always be found, however, and euthanasia is often used for the excess animals to make room for
        newer pets, unless the organization has a no-kill policy. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that
        2.4 million healthy, adoptable cats and dogs are euthanized each year in the US because of a lack of homes.
        Animal protection advocates campaign for adoption instead of buying animals in order to reduce the number of
        animals who have to be euthanized. Many shelters and animal rescues encourage the education of spaying or
        neutering a pet in order to reduce the number of animals euthanized in shelters and to help control the pet
        population.

    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        To help lower the number of animals euthanized each year, some shelters have developed a no-kill policy. Best
        Friends Animal Society is the largest no-kill shelter in the United States who adopts policies such as "Save
        Them All". Like this shelter and many others, they strive to keep their animals as long as it takes to find
        them new homes. City shelters and government funded shelters rarely have this policy because of the large number
        of animals they receive. No-kill shelters are usually run by groups that have volunteers or individuals with
        enough space to foster pets until a permanent home can be found. However, many of these groups and individuals
        have a finite number of spaces available. This means they will not take in new animals unless a space opens up,
        although they will often take back pets that they have adopted out previously. Sometimes they try to find the
        animals foster homes, in which the animal is placed in a home temporarily until someone adopts it.</p>
